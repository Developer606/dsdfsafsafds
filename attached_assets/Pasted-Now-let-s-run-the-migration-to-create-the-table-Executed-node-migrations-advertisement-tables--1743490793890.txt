Let's update the migration file to use ES modules:


Edited migrations/advertisement-tables.js
Let's convert the file to ECMAScript Module (ESM) format:

Great! Now let's restart the application to see if it works properly with the new advertisement tables:


Restarted Start application
Excellent! The advertisement tables have been successfully created and initialized. Let's now check the server storage implementation to make sure it has the necessary methods for handling advertisements:


Opened server/storage.ts

Opened server/storage.ts
Now let's examine the advertisement routes:


Searched for "Find files related to advertisement routes"
Let's check if there's a method to increment advertisement stats (impressions, clicks) since it's referenced in the route handlers:


Opened server/storage.ts
Let's check if we need to implement any missing advertisement route methods:


Opened server/routes/advertisement-routes.ts
Let's check how this is imported into the main routes.ts file:


Opened server/routes.ts

Searched for "Find where the advertisement routes are registered in the Express app"
Let's check if the client-side code related to advertisements exists. Let's look for components and pages that would display the featured section:


Searched for "Find client-side code related to advertisements or featured section"
Let's check the client-side code to see if we need to implement any components for the advertisements. First, let's look for the FeaturedSection component:


Searched for "Find client-side components related to Featured section or advertisements"
Let's create a client-side component for displaying advertisements in the Featured section. First, let's create the Advertisement component:

Let's create the directory first:


Executed mkdir -p client/src/components/advertisement
Now let's create the advertisement card component:


Created client/src/components/advertisement/advertisement-card.tsx
Now let's create the Featured section component that will display active advertisements:


Created client/src/components/advertisement/featured-section.tsx
Now let's create the admin interface for managing advertisements:


Created client/src/components/admin/advertisement-manager.tsx
Now let's add the advertisement components to the admin dashboard page:


Searched for "Find the admin dashboard page component"
Let's create a new admin page for managing advertisements:


Created client/src/pages/admin-advertisements.tsx
Now let's update the App.tsx file to include the new admin advertisements route:

Let's view the entire App.tsx file:


Opened client/src/App.tsx
Now let's update the App.tsx file to add the new admin advertisements route:


Edited client/src/App.tsx
Let's add the new advertisement route to the App.tsx file:


Edited client/src/App.tsx
Let's add a link to the admin dashboard to access our new advertisement management page:


Opened client/src/pages/admin-dashboard.tsx
Let's look at the dashboard menu:


Opened client/src/pages/admin-dashboard.tsx
Let's continue searching for the dashboard menu:


Searched for "Find hamburger menu or admin navigation in admin dashboard"
Let's update the admin dashboard menu to include our advertisement page:


Opened client/src/pages/admin-dashboard.tsx
Let's find the admin hamburger menu:


Opened client/src/pages/admin-dashboard.tsx
Let's look further down in the file:


Opened client/src/pages/admin-dashboard.tsx
Let's update the admin dashboard menu to include the advertisements page:


Edited client/src/pages/admin-dashboard.tsx
Let's use bash to find the admin menu in the admin dashboard file:


Executed grep -n "Admin Menu" client/src/pages/admin-dashboard.tsx | head -n 20
Let's look at the admin menu to find where to add our advertisements link:


Executed grep -n -A20 "Admin Menu" client/src/pages/admin-dashboard.tsx | head -n 30
Let's look at more of the menu:


Executed grep -n -A30 "Content Moderation" client/src/pages/admin-dashboard.tsx | head -n 40
Now let's update the admin dashboard menu to include our advertisements page link:


Edited client/src/pages/admin-dashboard.tsx
Now let's fix the LSP errors in the advertisement-related components:


Edited client/src/components/admin/advertisement-manager.tsx
Let's fix the Button variant in the admin-advertisements.tsx file:


Edited client/src/pages/admin-advertisements.tsx
