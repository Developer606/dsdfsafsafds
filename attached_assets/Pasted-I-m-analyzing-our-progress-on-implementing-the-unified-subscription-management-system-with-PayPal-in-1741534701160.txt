I'm analyzing our progress on implementing the unified subscription management system with PayPal integration.

Looking at what we've accomplished:

âœ… Created PayPal payment component (paypal-payment.tsx) with consistent interface
âœ… Updated subscription-management.tsx with multi-step payment flow
âœ… Updated subscription-dialog.tsx to use shared PayPal component
âœ… Fixed API response handling in the PayPal component
âœ… Added proper PayPal order creation parameters

I see we need to implement the server-side payment verification endpoints next. We tried to view the routes.ts file but encountered an issue accessing it. I'll continue working on implementing the backend payment verification.

I see we need to continue implementing the server-side portions of our payment system. Let's first search for any existing subscription endpoints in the routes.ts file to understand what we're working with.

Now, I need to see if there's an existing payment verification endpoint:

Let's check the existing payment verification endpoint:

I see we already have both endpoints:

/api/verify-payment - Verifies payments with PayPal API
/api/subscribe - Activates subscriptions after payment verification
Let's also check for node-fetch import in the routes.ts file:

I've been analyzing our progress on implementing the unified subscription payment system. Let me summarize what we've accomplished and what's next:

âœ… Created shared PayPal payment component (paypal-payment.tsx)
âœ… Updated subscription-management.tsx with multi-step payment flow
âœ… Modified subscription-dialog.tsx to use shared PayPal component
âœ… Fixed API response handling in the PayPal component

I've found that we already have the necessary server-side endpoints in place:

/api/verify-payment - Verifies payments with PayPal API
/api/subscribe - Activates subscriptions after payment verification
I'll continue implementing the remaining backend components to complete the unified subscription system.

After analyzing the codebase, I can see we need to install the node-fetch package for the payment verification endpoint, and fix the import in the routes.ts file. Let's do that:

Now, let's check if we have set the correct environment variables for PayPal:

Great! We've confirmed that both the PayPal Client ID and Secret are properly set as environment variables.

Let's make sure there's a corresponding environment variable on the client side for the PayPal Client ID:
