Looking at my progress so far:
✓ Analyzed the repository structure
✓ Found relevant files for the character and messaging system
→ Understanding proactive messaging system implementation

Based on what I can see, this appears to be a chat application with AI characters. The code includes:

A character database system (character-db.ts)
Socket.IO implementation for real-time messaging
A proactive messaging system that allows characters to initiate conversations
The proactive messaging system specifically allows AI characters to send messages based on:

Character personality types (outgoing, balanced, reserved)
User inactivity periods
Daily message limits
I'll continue analyzing the implementation details to provide a more complete understanding.

I can see that the application has started successfully. The logs show the initialization of various components of the application, including:

Encryption tables
Advertisement features
Password reset tracking
Messages database
Character database
Admin database
Notifications system
Email transport

There's a 401 error for the /api/user endpoint, but that's expected since no user is authenticated yet. The Socket.IO connection was also rejected for the same reason.

The proactive messaging feature that was mentioned in the uploaded file is already implemented. This feature allows AI characters to initiate conversations with users based on various factors like:

Character personality types (outgoing, balanced, reserved)
User inactivity periods
Daily message limits
User's personality and preferences
The feature has several components:

Different configurations for character personality types
A conversation tracking system
A scanning function that runs periodically to find opportunities to send proactive messages
A personalized prompt generation system based on user analysis
Would you like me to explain the current implementation in more detail, or would you like to enhance a specific aspect of the proactive messaging system?

read it fully "Is it possible for the character to have independent thinking, learning, and memory capabilities—enabling it to remember important details and proactively engage with the user without needing any input? Based on chat history and sentiment analysis, the character should be able to decide what to talk about next and initiate messages on its own, just like a real human would. However, the character send messages only when the user has actively opened the chat page and the conversation is ongoing"

I understand your request. You want to enhance the character's proactive messaging system to have more advanced capabilities:

Independent thinking and learning
Memory of important details from past conversations
Proactive engagement based on conversation history and sentiment analysis
Messages should only be sent when the user is actively on the chat page
Let me analyze the current implementation and suggest enhancements.

Currently, the proactive messaging system:

Scans conversations periodically (as shown in the logs)
Uses a probability-based approach with weighted factors (time, day, conversation intensity)
Makes decisions based on randomness and likelihood thresholds
Let me check more of the current implementation to provide tailored enhancements:


Opened server/services/proactive-messaging.ts

Opened server/services/proactive-messaging.ts
Let me check how socket connections are monitored to detect active users:


Searched for "Find how socket connections are monitored to detect active users"
Based on my analysis of the code, I'll implement enhancements to the proactive messaging system to match your requirements. Here's my plan:

Add memory capabilities to track important conversation details
Implement sentiment analysis for better context understanding
Enhance the system to only send messages when the user is active on the chat page
Add independent "thinking" ability to decide what topics to bring up
Let me create the implementation:

Searched for "Find message storage structure and database implementation"
Let me check the messages-db.ts file specifically:


Searched for "Find messages-db.ts file and message database implementation"
Let me check specifically for the AI character messages implementation:


Searched for "Find how AI character messages are stored and retrieved"
I'm analyzing the code and requirements to implement character independent thinking, learning, and memory capabilities. Let me review what I've found so far:

✓ Located the messages storage in messages.db
✓ Found the character-user interaction implementation
✓ Analyzed the proactive messaging system

Your requirement is to enhance characters with:

Independent thinking
Learning capabilities
Memory to remember important details
Ability to proactively engage with users
Sentiment analysis to guide conversations
Decision-making about new conversation topics
Additionally, you want proactive messages to only be sent when the user has the chat page open and the conversation is active.

The current system already has some of these capabilities, but we need to enhance it. I'll continue working on this implementation.

Let's continue implementing the client-side activity tracking for our AI character chat feature. We need to modify the Chat component to emit the chat page activity events.

Now that I've reviewed the socket-io-client.ts file, I need to extend it to support our new chat session activity events:


Edited client/src/lib/socket-io-client.ts

Excellent! We've successfully integrated the chat session activity tracking system. Now, when a user opens a chat page with a character, the server will be notified, and when they leave, the server will be notified as well.

Improve proactive messaging accuracy by refining message timestamp handling and personality analysis.
I've implemented character memory capabilities and activity tracking for proactive messaging. Key improvements:

✓ Created character-memory.ts service to track important conversation details
✓ Modified proactive-messaging.ts for sentiment analysis and user interest tracking
✓ Added Socket.IO events for tracking user activity on chat pages
✓ Updated client-side chat.tsx to notify server when users enter/leave chat pages
✓ Fixed message timestamp handling issues for proper timing analysis

The system now allows characters to:

Remember important details from conversations
Learn from user interactions
Make decisions about conversation topics
Only send messages when users are active on chat pages
Is there anything else you'd like me to explain or improve about this implementation?

I see the issue in the screenshot. The character is sending too many proactive messages, even when the user may not be actively engaged in the chat section. Let's fix this behavior in the proactive messaging system.

The primary issue is that the character activity detection system isn't working correctly. Let's modify the condition in the sendProactiveMessage function to ensure messages are only sent when the user is actually active on the chat page:


Opened server/services/proactive-messaging.ts
Let's check how the scanConversations function is working:


Opened server/services/proactive-messaging.ts
Let's check the implementation of the isChatSessionActive function since that's what should be preventing messages when the user is not on the chat page:


Executed grep -n "function isChatSessionActive" server/services/character-memory.ts
Let's view the isChatSessionActive function:


Opened server/services/character-memory.ts
Let's check where activeChatSessions is defined:


Executed grep -n "activeChatSessions" server/services/character-memory.ts
Let's check the mark functions for chat sessions:


Opened server/services/character-memory.ts
Let's check if our Socket.IO server is properly handling the chat page events:


Executed grep -n "chat_page_open\|chat_page_close" server/socket-io-server.ts
Let's see how these events are handled:


Opened server/socket-io-server.ts
I see the issue now. Let's update the shouldSendProactiveMessage function to reduce message frequency and check the time between messages:


Opened server/services/proactive-messaging.ts
Let's look at the personality configs to see the current message frequency settings:


Executed grep -A 20 "personalityConfigs" server/services/proactive-messaging.ts
I've analyzed the issue with the proactive messaging system. Looking at the screenshot and your feedback:

✓ Implemented character memory service
✓ Added user activity tracking via socket events
→ Fixing issue with proactive messages being sent when user isn't active

I see the problem - characters are sending too many messages even when users aren't actually in the chat section. This is happening because our check for active chat sessions isn't being properly respected in the message sending logic.

I'll fix this by ensuring proactive messages are strictly limited to when users are actually viewing the chat page.

Fix excessive looping of character messages
I can see we have a new server output and the issue with the proactive messaging is clearer now. Let's fix the issue to ensure characters only send messages when users are actively viewing the chat page.

I'll make the following changes:

First, let's update the shouldSendProactiveMessage function to be stricter about checking if the user is active on the chat page:

Now, let's update the scanConversations function to ensure we're strictly checking for chat session activity:


Edited server/services/proactive-messaging.ts
Now let's add additional debugging to track the client-side chat activity more effectively:


Opened client/src/pages/chat.tsx
Let's look for the useEffect hook in the chat page where we might be tracking page visibility:


Executed grep -n "useEffect" -A 5 client/src/pages/chat.tsx | grep -A 15 "socketManager" | head -30
Let's see the entire useEffect hook for page visibility tracking:


Opened client/src/pages/chat.tsx
Let's check the socketManager.notifyChatPageOpen method to confirm it's sending the correct events:


Opened client/src/lib/socket-io-client.ts
Let's find the notifyChatPageOpen and notifyChatPageClose methods:

Improve proactive messaging by adding chat session activity tracking.
Great! The application has successfully restarted and the changes are now active. I've made several key improvements to fix the issue with proactive messaging:

Added a strict check for chat session activity before sending messages
Enhanced client-side page visibility tracking using document.visibilityState
Added additional logging to improve debugging and visibility
Restructured the message sending logic to prioritize active sessions
Let's finalize our changes by modifying the message frequency settings to be more conservative:
